# Personal_Projects
This repository will contain the files of my personal projects. 

As a self-taught programmer, I have made it an imperative to practise skills I find interesting and document my findings and progress.

Therefore, this repository acts as my journal and sketchbook as I apply myself into the endeavor of web-development.
