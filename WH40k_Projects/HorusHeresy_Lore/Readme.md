# The Horus Heresy

The Horus Heresy is an event within the WH40k universe as well as a spin-off series of the original WH40k brand. 

I am a fan of The Horus Heresy and it's originator and as such, I have created a website chronicling the events of the titular fictional event. 
Not only is this meant to be a sign of appreciation for a fictional series this project will also act as a canvas for myself to practise and apply web-development skills I am currently learning. 

Such skills will include:
- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript
