# Warhammer 40,000_Projects
As a fan of Games Workshops Warhammer 40,000 (WH40k) franchise, I have consumed an abundance of lore from the series of books from the Black Library publisher. 

As a culmination of my interest in web-development and the grim-dark fantasy of WH40k, I will be creating projects centered on the fictional lore of WH40k. 

While there will be numerous recollections of WH40k written-material, I am not an employee of Games Workshop nor am I being paid to create such content associated with the company and its affiliated brands and properties. 

All my personal projects are simply created to practise my web-development skills and to appreciate the works associated with WH40k.
